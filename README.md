boggle.py, a simple Boggle game solver
======================================

Just a little Python program I wrote to help me cheat at Boggle. :-)

You can run it without arguments to generate a random board and solve it:

    python boggle.py

Or with 25 letters representing a board to specify the board:

    python boggle  T N N H A  I G N E I  S G E I B  C A H N I  O N F O E
